/**
# Change log:
# Version 1 - initial commit
# Version 2 - updated possible positive cases (typo in name of concept set name) and added additional NIH VSAC codeset_id
# NOTE: as of V2, OMOP vocabularies have released an update to include new LOINC codes but the load of these concept_ids into atlas-covid19 has not been completed, when this is done we will include these into the concept_set generated
# Version 3 - consolidated to single cohort definition and added N3C COHORT table + labeling statements

# Instructions:
# Cohorts were assembled using OHDSI Atlas (atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org)
# This MS SQL script is the artifact of this ATLAS cohort definition: http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/947
# If desiredd to evaluate feasibility of each cohort, individual cohorts are available:
# 1- “Lab-confirmed positive cases” (http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/655)
# 2- "Lab-confirmed negative cases" (http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/656)
# 3- "Suspected positive cases"	(http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/657)
# 4- "Possible positive cases" (http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/658)

# To run, you will need to find and replace @cdm_database_schema, @vocabulary_database_schema with your local OMOP schema details
# Harmonization note:
# In OHDSI conventions, we do not usually write tables to the main database schema.
# NOTE: OHDSI uses @cohortDatabaseSchema as a results schema build cohort tables for specific analysis. We built the N3C_COHORT table in this results schema as we know many OMOP analyst do not have write access to their @cdm_database_schema.


# Begin building cohort following OHDSI standard cohort definition process
